I asked him what the reason was but he just answered that he got a feeling that he should deliver flowers to a girl in this specific village. I got the chills, because I remembered the man with a bouquet of flowers from the séance."'

We reached the entrance of the forest pretty quickly and decided that it would be best to split up to complete the task faster. Since we were familiar with the area we all dispersed to our cherished spots and began gathering berries."'
					'"My favorite spot was a plot surrounded by dense bushes and in the middle of the plot there was a huge stump. It’’s was really a great spot and as I approached I noticed very large number of ripe strawberries. I was rejoicing over the thought that I would gather more than my brothers, slowly gathering the berries and putting them in my berry collector. All of a sudden I hear some rustling behind the bushes. I turn towards the sound, but I''m met with silence. I didn''t notice anyone but I still couldn''t get rid of the eerie feeling."'
					'"I shook off the eerie feeling and go back gathering strawberries again. All of a sudden I get this strange feeling... I look up and I see a person squatting on the stump. He''s completely still and just stares at me. I got really scared and ran away screaming and crying towards my brothers. They tried to stop and calm me down, but I just kept on running. My brothers started running after me, trying to keep up. I could hear my oldest brother shouting to run towards the kolkhoz. You see <<$pcs_nickname>> long time ago we had central collective farms that were called kolkhoz, your grandma explains."'
					'"We were lucky that the farms were close to the forest and didn''t have to run through the woods for long. I kept looking back if this person was following us but there was no sign of him. We knew we were safe when we see the farmers belonging to the brigade. My brothers and I ran up to the foreman and explained to him what had happened. He immediately grabbed the phone and called someone. The other farmers reassured us that we were safe now. After we had calmed down we got sent home. Our mother met as at home, she fed us and comforted me."'
					'"The following day we were informed that not far from the train station Ratomka some people found dismantled railroad rails. Apparently it was done by the same man that I came across in the forest. I didn''t know it then but before the war our area was prone to sabotage by infiltrators, and staying hidden was easy, as the territory is covered by forest, stretching all the way to the border."'
					'"Ever since that day the fear I experienced never disappeared, as I''ve felt it through my whole life. I’ll carry on this fear for the remaining days of my life…"'

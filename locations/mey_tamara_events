			'Grabbing you by the elbow, she leads you to the very couple that had awoken your attention, "Bronson" and his lady friend.'
			'She greets the man like an old friend, kissing him on the cheek, but indifferently greets his lady friend. "Something complicated happened between these two..." you think to yourself.'
			'<font color="maroon"><i>"Let me introduce my pupil, <<$pcs_nickname>>."</i></font>'
			'"Bronson" smiles, making you back off a bit seeing his face up close. It looks quite rough like someone had slashed his face with a razor. Him missing teeth makes his smile seem off and crooked. But despite the roughly slashed face and crooked smile, he seems very sincere.'
			'<font color="maroon"><i>"It''s so nice meeting someone young here! The only other people here are old goblins and hags... But not you, with your youth and beauty, you''re like a ray of light! You have to forgive an old man for the bad compliments, <<$pcs_firstname>>."</i></font>'
			'<font color="maroon"><i>"My dear Tamara! You always had a great eye for talent!"</i></font>'
			'<font color="maroon"><i>"I still remember your scent, it''s the same one when you helped me many years ago... When I had to get away from my husband..."</i></font> sighed Tamara Mikhailovna with concealed sadness briefly glancing at him. <font color="navy"><i>"There''s definitely something going on here."</i></font> you think to yourself.'
			'<font color="maroon"><i>"Well, let''s not dwell on the past. Let bygones be bygones!</i></font> "Bronson" smiles, answering without any malice or mockery. His friend, feeling clearly undesirable in this conversation, places her half empty glass of champagne on the table, grabbing a new one from a passing waiter, silently walked away towards the musicians. She moves away without having said one word.'
			'You keep up the small talk. "Bronson" gradually looks at you like he''s trying to read you. With some help by Tamara Mikhailovna you don''t get embarrassed by this prying eyes. The way the two of them behave it''s quite obvious that they’re old friends, though you believe that they''re more than friends.'
			'<font color="maroon"><i>"<<$pcs_firstname>>, will you make an old man happy and dine with him?"</i></font> he asks you confidently. The way he conduct himself in a conversation, despite the sloppy appearance, makes him somehow, likable and not frightening.'
			'<font color="navy"><i>"I would be honoured."</i></font>'
			'<font color="maroon"><i>"Well, then it''s settled, <<$pcs_firstname>>!"</i></font> "Bronson" smiles and moves away from you and aunt Tamara. You suddenly realize that he didn''t ask you about your number, now that you think about it, he never properly introduced himself, even though you talked for a good hour!'

I miscalculated something, for example due to sharp hormonal change you have bad acme on your face and I failed to change your eyes and lips. On the bright side, your body will change much faster than one of a natural born woman. That means it will be easier to gain and lose weight and change facial features. All in all you turned quite well. By the way, your new ''equipment'' down there is fully functional, so if you don''t want to be a mommy, you should think about using contraceptives."'

On a side note, I already took care of an alibi. Today Michael crashed his car into the pit and died, it''s on the news." With these words, Tatiana picked up the remote and turned on the TV.'

There are very few supplies already in the apartment, but they''ll only last you a day or two. There''s no TV either. Then get a job. Not far from your new home is a small café, if I remember correctly there was a vacant waitress position not too long ago. You should talk to the owner of the café about the job. Don''t forget to monitor your health, keep your mood up and have a clear mind."'

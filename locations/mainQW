				'You get up from the couch and dress and ask Tatiana, "So? Did you learn anything else about me?"'
				'"Yes, but first I need to explain the basic magic theory. Listen closely and listen hard, I will not repeat this. Magical energy in Asian culture is called chakra and is produced by all living organisms. This vital energy, if deprived of its body begins to slowly die, you can use this magic but it then needs time before it will be replaced. Every body has a limit that can be slowly increased through training."'
				'"There is magical energy in the grass, trees and people but not in dead matter it is the energy of life itself. Although everyone has this energy, the body protects itself and prohibits the use of it. It is easy to exhaust the body and can kill yourself. Mages are able to bypass the body''s defenses and separate themselves from this energy and shape it into effect."'
				'"But even mages can not collect more energy than they can contain. Thanks to the amulet you can potentially contain more energy than any magician could dream of. You just need to learn how to use it. As I understand it, your orgasms are capable of converting the energy that is inaccessible and converting it into magical energy you can use. Through this you could obtain a magical energy supply that is almost limitless, unlike other magicians."'
				'"You know, you''re theoretically the most powerful magician in the world. Perhaps there is magic that can only you could wield, those scrolls that were in the archive with the amulet may have been useful in understanding this."'
				'You shout. "I have to go back there."'
				'"That''s not so easy, the site is closed and guarded, but we managed to get in there and the scrolls have not aged well. The papyrus has dried out so much that it crumbles if you try and open it and the ink has faded away."'
				'"We met Reinhold there, he represents the council of the highest order. They are the old ones and hold council on the highest matters of magic we must be careful not to upset them or attract the attention of demons."'
				'"Woah! Demons?'
				'"Demons, you know, creatures from other plains of existence. It''s possible that Rikudo was a demon, but demons unlike him are beings with terrible force, blunt and aggressive. Something like beasts woven from pure magic. Much like the fae, they have different types and they possess different magics and skills, but these are not cute or friendly."'
				if StoryLine = 0 and magikDostup = 0:
					'"Got it. Hey, you can turn me back into a man?"'
					'"I can''t. I drew the energy you were emitting from the amulet, I don''t hold anything like the energy required and you have only access to the smallest hint of the potential of the amulet. It might be possible if your magical energies are much higher and you somehow pass me all your energy that I can reverse the spell, but this is unlikely and could put you back in the position you were in when we met. I''m sorry."'
				end
				'Tatiana continues, "Do not worry so much about the future. Develop your body, learn to fight, study magic and train your mind. Gradually everything will become clear to you, at least that is what my old sensei said."'

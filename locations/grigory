You can see him looking you over, his eyes lingering momentarily on your breasts before he blushes slightly and pulls you into a small hug before sitting you back down, "You''ve grown into quite the woman,"  He says, glancing at the cows in the field.'

				'He ends up falling about two thirds onto the bed, and after a couple of minutes, you''re able to get him the rest of the way onto the bed.  By then, you can hear the soft sounds of his snoring.'
				'You can''t help but smile while looking at him, his naked ass sticking up into the air.  You quickly pull the covers over him.'
				'After a  few seconds consideration, you pull remove your own shoes, then pull back the covers on the other side of the bed before crawling in beside him.'

The first thing you notice is that all of Grigory''s clothes have been picked up, and that the end table has been moved back to where it belongs.  The second is when you look out the living room window and notice that his truck is gone.'

	'Walking in the darkness, you see a shape between the houses.  Slowing your pace, you watch as Grigory moves into view.'
	'"Hey there Kiska,"  His voice has a slightly drunken slur.'
	'"Hi Grigory,"  You say, feeling suddenly uncomfortable with the way he is looking at you.'
	'Grigory takes a sip from his flask, his eyes never leaving your body as he does so, "Good girls should be home in bed at this hour,"  He says, his voice husky, "But you''re just a little tease aren''t you?  You like to toy with men''s emotions."'

		'Maybe I''ve been out of line?  You think, looking up at the big man as he looms over you.'
		'Suddenly, he takes a step towards you, his arms wrapping around you in a grip that''s just a little too tight, "Grigory, you''re hurting me,"  You manage to say as he squeezes the air from your lungs.'
		'The grip lingers for another second, then he lets go suddenly.  '
		'Your chest aches just a little as you take a deep breath.  After a few seconds of breathing again, "Grigory?"  You call his name softly, keeping just a little distance between the two of you, "I never mean to hurt you, if I tease you a little, its because you''re my friend."'
		'"Friend,"  The word sounds bitter coming from Grigory''s mouth.'
		'"I think you need to go home, get some sleep,"  You venture, "Can I help you to your truck?"  Even as you ask, you wonder how you''d ever be able to help the giant of a man get to his truck considering how much smaller than him you are.'
		'Taking a step towards you again, he doesn''t embrace you this time, instead he leans forward, his lips touching your forehead.  The smell of alcohol is strong on him, "Later Kiska,"  He mumbles, then turns and starts walking away.'

		'Then, faster than you ever imagined the big man could move, he closes the distance between you, picking you up in a crushing hug that makes your ribs hurt.  His lips press against yours, and the taste of the alcohol on his tongue is enough to make your head swim.'

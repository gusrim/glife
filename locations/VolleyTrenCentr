		'"<<$name>>, what are you doing here?" Mikhail asked you in astonishment.'
		'"well, I wanted to improve my physical fitness and since the sports club doesn''t open until 16:00, I figured it was worth the trip into the city to come here." you explained hastily.' 
		'The coach looked at you with an approving nod, "That is good, <<$name>>."'
		'The stranger smiled at you and said, "I am Guang. Your coach and I are old friends from when we used to compete against each other. He represented the people of the Soviet Republics and I, naturally, represented the people of the republic of China. After my team beat his so many times, his government finally convinced me to change sides as it were. Now I train the atheletes of the Russian Federation and Mikhail and I meet here from time to time."'

Dumbfounded, Guang stared at you, unable to get a word in edgewise for the next few minutes as you jumped from subject to subject without pause.' 
			'Guang finally managed to fing himself into the conversation as you paused momentarily to draw in a breat.'
			'"If you don''t know these things, it means that Misha didn''t tell you, so why should I tell you and betray my friend''s trust?" he asked you.'
			'You were at a loss, not knowing how to proceed. Fearing that he was going to continue to scold you, you prepared to leave.'
			'"Now, if you had some huangjiu, I would happily answer some of your questions." he said dreamily.'
			'You stared at the Chinese trainer in puzzlement, not understanding what he is asking for.'
			'"Huangjiu is rice wine from my country." he explained sighing wistfully, "Sadly, it is hard to find outside of great cities like St. Petersburg or Moscow."'
			'"Okay, so if I bring you a bottle of wungzoo wine you will answer my questions?" you ask eagerly.'
			'"Huangjiu," he corrected you, "It is called huangjiu. If you find me a bottle, I will answer any question you like."'
			'"It is a deal." you exclaimed and started to head for the door then turned back to Guang, "Where can I find your rice wine, your Huangjiu?"'
			'The older man just smiled at you and shrugged.'
			'You think about it and remember there were a couple of Chinese merchants at the market back home. Maybe one of them will have the rice wine.'

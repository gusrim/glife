				'"Yep," she laughs, "if you wanna really understand how magic works and why it does this at one time and that at another, you gotta get some reading done. Trust me, if there was any way around it, I would have found it. But magic makes the reading easier and quicker, and it''s sooo worth it. The things you can do once you grasp what energies the universe holds are incredible. And I''ve only just scratched the surface."'
				'"What do you mean by ''energies of the universe''? I thought you said that magic only exists in living things, like plants and animals."'
				'"Did I?" She looks thoughtful but shrugs again. "Well, it''s a little complicated, but to put it simply: When scientists speak of ''dark matter'' and ''dark energy'', then, in reality, they are trying to explain the magic in this plane of existence and all the others, like demons and the magic that exists in their ''dimension'' or whatever you''d wanna call it. But," she waves her hand as if to shoo away a pesky fly, "you don''t have to concern yourself with that right now. When the time comes, Reinhold can explain it to you in more detail - hell, considering that he''s your mentor, I''ve done an awful lot of explaining already... Now, let''s go!"'

!		'Tatiana lays both folders back where they belong and her expression turns serious. "Remember how I told you that magic has a natural tendency to stay hidden? Well, there''s a limit to that tendency, a threshold beyond which either the magic cannot stay hidden anymore or at which the normal person cannot explain what they''re seeing with some non-magical phenomenon, we''re not sure which - in other words, humans have a breaking point, and when they are pushed beyond that, most of them realize how the world really is... and lose their minds."'
!		'"Could that have happened to me?" You shiver at the thought.'
!		'"Honestly, I have no idea," Tatiana admits, "but the power you have absorbed since then is huge, even if you can''t really use it to its full potential, and that may have very well driven most regular mages insane, so we''re moving in unknown territory here."'
!		'You nod solemnly, suddenly very appreciative of the mental health and stability you always took for granted. "So, you investigate anything that might have magical causes to prevent people from going crazy?"'
!		'"It''s even bigger than that, <<$pcs_firstname>>. We know that this threshold exists. Every mage witnesses it sooner or later." She stops, momentarily lost in thought, but quickly recovers. "We have a theory that, if too many people are exposed to too much magic at once, it might break the illusion for everybody; you know, like a nuclear bomb goes off when you reach a critical mass."'
!		'"Which would then drive everybody insane," you conclude.'
!		'"Maybe not everybody," she corrects, "but many of them. And those that wouldn''t go insane, well, who knows what they''d do? Go on witch hunts? Try to kill all succubi and fae? Attempt to harness the magic of the universe? It would destroy the world as we know it, that''s for sure."'
